Index

This repository holds all of my personal projects that I've done over the years. Currently they're binned in three different categories

Personal Programming Projects
Python
Data Science
Scripts
Software Development
CPP Education Research
Public Tableau Visualizations
Each category has their own variety of projects and should be accompanied by some form of documentation.

Background

Hello!

My name is Darwin Agunos and welcome to my Project Portfolio! A little bit about me. I did my undergraduate at Cal Poly Pomona where I majored in Physics with an emphasis on applications computational sciences. In my undergraduate studies I was a Physics Education Researcher where I spent my time analyzing the effectiveness of certain instructional pedagogies on student performance, sentiment analysis on students perceptions of the physics-math intersection in quantum mechanics and the analysis of how demographics affect student performance (e.g. gender/racial gaps in student performance).

Now I focus on programming for whatever problems come my way, automating my life wherever I can and conducting analysis on topics that interest me!
