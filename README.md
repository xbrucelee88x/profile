Bruce - Projects Portfolio

Index

This repository holds all of my personal projects that I've done over the years. Currently they're binned in three different categories

Personal Programming Projects
Python
Data Science
Scripts
Software Development
CPP Education Research
Public Tableau Visualizations
Each category has their own variety of projects and should be accompanied by some form of documentation.

Background

Hello!

My name is Bruce and welcome to my Project Portfolio! A little bit about me. I did my undergraduate at U Toronto where I majored in Finance. In my undergraduate studies I was a Researcher.

Now I focus on programming for whatever problems come my way, automating my life wherever I can and conducting analysis on topics that interest me!
